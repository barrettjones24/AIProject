Hi, my name is Barrett Jones. I did my AI admission project using the Zillow dataset from kagle. In this competition the goal is to try to improve the Zillow Housing Price prediction model. They give you a data set of properties with the corresponding log error from their model. Some of the data fields they provide to attempt to train your model include: square feet, number of bedrooms, zip code, and many others. The dataset is pretty large, so I reduced it to 10,000 rows to do some initial testing of the data. Also, there is quite a bit of missing data in this dataset. I don\'92t get into that too much in my project, but in order to do well in this competition you would need to handle the missing data well. \

## Brief Project Description\
\
I will compare two different regression modeling techniques. First, I will take a look at a multi-level model with random intercepts. Following that I will take a look at a generalized additive model with some polynomial predictors. }# AI-Admission-Project-bwj
